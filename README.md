# Garmin Ant Agent Puppet Module for Boxen

Installs the Garmin Ant Agent. I'm using Boxen to provision my personal army of
Macs, and I want this installed on them.

This module is derived from the [Boxen Puppet Template](https://github.com/boxen/puppet-template).

## Usage

```puppet
include garmin_ant_agent
```

## Required Puppet Modules

None.

## Development

Write code. Run `script/cibuild` to test it. Check the `script`
directory for other useful tools.
